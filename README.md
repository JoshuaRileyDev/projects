# Projects

Projects is an extension I'm super proud to be releasing, it's been probably over a year in development now and it's something I quite literally use every single day, it allows me to manage all of my projects all in one place and just a keyboard stroke away from being opened.

Here are just a few of the features:

- Create projects from templates (either commands or copying a folder)
- Use {projectName} or {projectSlug} to make it dynamic in the folder's contents
- Open projects in terminal or respective application super quickly.
- Filter by project category (ie NodeJS or React etc)
- Filter by aliases
- Create or auto-create Github repositories.
- Work with Coolify
